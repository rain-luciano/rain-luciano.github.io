### About Me

Hey, thanks for checking my website out!

I am a Data Visualization Engineer with a specialization on Power BI. Using my proficiency in dashboard UI/UX design and Power BI best practices, I find fulfillment in bridging the gap between non-technical individuals and data. 

Let's collaborate on transforming data into actionable insights and compelling stories.

### Background

I graduated from Ateneo de Manila University with a Bachelor's (2021) and Master's (2022) degree in Applied Mathematics Major in Mathematical Finance. I am currently a Data Visualization Engineer at [LENA - Lately, Everything Needs Analytics](https://www.lena.com.ph/).
