#### About Me

I am a Data Visualization Engineer with a focus on Power BI. Using my proficiency in dashboard UI/UX design and Power BI best practices, I find fulfillment in bridging the gap between non-technical individuals and data. Let's collaborate on transforming data into actionable insights and compelling stories.

#### Background

I graduated from Ateneo de Manila University in 2022 with a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Applied Mathematics with Specialization in Mathematical Finance (AMF). I am currently a Data Visualization Engineer at [LENA - Lately, Everything Needs Analytics](https://www.lena.com.ph/).
